# cryptox

OpenSSL C++ Wrapper

A simple header-only C++ OpenSSL Wrapper for C++03 and up.

## Quick Examples

In order to simplify examples we assume these two lines at the top of all snippets:

```
#include <cryptox/message_digests/hash.hxx>
using namespace cryptox;
```

### Message Digests

#### > Hash as a std::string

Hashing a C string:

```
std::string as_string = hash<md5>("Hello world!");
```

Hashing bytes:

```
char buffer[] = { 0x00, 0x10, 0x20, 0x30 };
std::string as_string = hash<sha1>(buffer, sizeof(buffer));
```

Hash range of values:

```
std::vector<char> v = ...
std::string as_string = hash<sha256>(v.begin(), v.end());
```

Or a container at once:

```
std::vector<char> v = ...
std::string as_string = hash<sha512>(v);
```

#### > Hash as a boost::array<>

Hashing a C string:

```
md5::digest_type as_bytes = digest<md5>("Hello world!");
```

All the overloads of the previous example apply.

## The API

### Message Digests

[Message Digests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) are implemented using cryptox::message_digester\<Algorithm\>, which is a class template that takes the desired hashing algorithm as a parameter. However, there are two high-level functions that ease most use cases.

A Message Digest is defined as a function that reduces a given input to a fixed width binary value, called the Digest, or more commonly, the Hash.

For the purposes of simplification, this library uses the words *digest* for binary values, and *hash* for textual hexadecimal representations of the digest. However, they have the same meaning in academic publishing.

#### High-level API

Two high-level functions are provided to get hashes: one for binary results and one for a hexadecimal representation of it. That is, digest<Algorithm>() and hash<Algorithm>(), respectively.

### Hash Algorithms

The hash algorithms that are wrapped are from OpenSSL EVP. At the moment, these are the available algorithms:

| **Algorithm** | **Digest Length** |
|:-------------:|:-----------------:|
|      md2      |        128        |
|      sha      |        160        |
|      sha1     |        160        |
|     sha224    |        224        |
|     sha256    |        256        |
|     sha384    |        384        |
|     sha512    |        512        |

### Symmetric Encryption

In the works on a private branch.

## History
During almost two decades of professional software development I've created wrappers and code utilities that have been copied and pasted on my projects over and over. I'm putting them (rather slowly) into public repositories to help me organize my code and also to see if it helps other developers. As an added bonus, people can contribute and make the library better.

For now, only Message Digest code has been uploaded.
